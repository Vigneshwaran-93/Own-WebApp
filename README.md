# Own-WebApp (Under Building)
Set up your Own app easily

With the rise of AI, having knowledge of web app development has become essential. Web apps provide an interactive face for the solutions you've built, allowing you to showcase your work more effectively. While Streamlit is popular, it comes with some limitations in flexibility and ease of use. That's where Flask comes in ‚Äì a lightweight and powerful framework for building and deploying web applications with ease.

## üõ†Ô∏è Framework & Technologies

- **Framework**: Flask
- **Language**: Python, HTML, CSS
- **Requirements**: Any computer that can run Python

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project will guide you through creating your first Flask-based web app. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository will provide you with the tools and understanding to develop a fully functional web application.

## üìà Flowchart

Below is a flowchart that outlines the structure and flow of the web app:

### This will be an in-depth, unconventional guide to understanding web apps.

## Web Frameworks in Python
- Flask
- Django
- Streamlit
- FastAPI
- Pyramid and so on..

# Why Flask?

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework designed for simplicity and flexibility. It's perfect for building small to medium web applications and APIs, giving developers full control over their project's structure and components.

## Pros:
- **Simple and Easy to Use**: Quick setup with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Flexible**: Allows for custom project structure and is easily extensible.
- **Strong Community**: Large ecosystem with plenty of resources and third-party libraries.

## Cons:
- **Lacks Built-in Features**: No default admin panel, authentication, etc. (unlike Django).
- **Scaling Issues**: Can be more challenging to scale for very large applications.
- **Manual Setup**: Requires more setup for advanced features.

## Let's Start
### 1. Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Run the app
```bash
python app.py
```
